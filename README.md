Building a Career in Cloud and DevOps: A Guided Path

Welcome to a new project! I’m going to follow a mind map created and generated by AI, specifically designed to help me acquire the knowledge needed to become a Cloud/DevOps Engineer and, in turn, aim for better positions and salaries in the IT world. This is a field that truly excites me, is in high demand right now, and will very likely continue to be in the future.

The plan I’ll be sharing may take me more or less time than initially expected. Since I already work professionally in the IT sector, I believe I start with an advantage (hopefully finishing earlier). Of course, I will be adapting and refining the mind map as I discover more about the cloud world and its countless possibilities. This guide will be under constant review.

On the other hand, when I’m about halfway through this journey, I plan to focus heavily on programming as well. While my main professional interest lies in the DevOps path, for entrepreneurship it’s obvious that you need the ability to create things from scratch.

That said, I hope this introduction is valuable for you to learn something useful, and for me, it will serve as a real commitment to walk this path.
